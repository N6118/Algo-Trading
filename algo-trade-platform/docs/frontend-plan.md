# Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the frontend development plan for the algorithmic trading platform. It builds upon the overall platform plan and focuses specifically on the web-based dashboard and user interface components, optimized for U.S. markets.

## 1. Dashboard Overview

The web-based dashboard will serve as the primary interface for users to interact with the algorithmic trading platform. It will provide comprehensive views for:

- Strategy configuration and management
- Real-time trade monitoring
- Performance analytics and P&L reporting
- Risk management settings with U.S. regulatory compliance
- System configuration

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query with Context API (preferred over Redux for real-time data)
- **UI Components**: Material-UI or Ant Design with dark mode defaults
- **Data Visualization**: TradingView lightweight charts with D3.js for advanced visualizations
- **API Communication**: WebSocket-first approach with Axios for REST fallback
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Market Data**: IBKR WebSocket API with Polygon.io/IEX backup

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Authentication Module

- Login/logout functionality
- User profile management
- API key management for U.S. exchange connections (IBKR, Alpaca, etc.)
- Role-based access control

### 3.2 Strategy Configuration Interface

- Strategy creation and editing
- Parameter configuration for:
  - Signal scanning parameters with U.S. market hours (09:30-16:00 ET)
  - Signal generation parameters for U.S. exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE)
  - Risk management settings with PDT rule compliance
- Strategy activation/deactivation controls
- Strategy templates and duplication
- U.S. market calendar integration

### 3.3 Trade Monitoring Dashboard

- Real-time trade status display
- Active trades monitoring
- Order book visualization
- Position sizing calculator with Reg-T margin calculations
- Trade execution controls (manual override)
- Alert configuration
- Settlement date tracking (T+2)

### 3.4 Analytics and Reporting

- P&L visualization (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Strategy performance metrics
- Risk exposure analysis
- Deals report with filtering and export capabilities
- Historical trade analysis
- Correlation coefficient heatmap for strategy tuning

### 3.5 Risk Management Interface

- Risk parameter configuration
- Risk visualization (heat maps, exposure charts)
- Risk alerts and notifications
- Position sizing recommendations
- PDT rule monitoring
- Margin utilization tracking

### 3.6 System Configuration

- Universal settings management with U.S. market defaults
- API connection status and latency monitoring
- Database health monitoring
- System logs and alerts
- Data archiving configuration (SEC 17a-4 compliance)

## 4. UI/UX Design Principles

- Clean, professional interface optimized for financial data
- Dark mode as default with light mode option (optimized for traders in low-light environments)
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Customizable layouts and saved views
- Accessibility compliance
- Low-latency updates for critical information
- Clear visualization of regulatory constraints
